description: <p align= "left"> Inspired by the indie game Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, this game was designed and created by a small team using the game engine Unity and Photoshop. Check out this <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGrplchRjHw"> video </a> for gameplay and check out this <a href= "https://github.com/shankhan247/DROO"> git repository </a> for an executable to run the game. Read below for more details. </p> <h4 align="left"> About </h4> <p align= "left"> Don't Run Out of Oxygen is a cooperative 4 player game focused on manning a tactical submarine under the sea to complete objectives and explore surrounding regions. The storyline is centered around a group of marine biologists who discovered that the ocean wildlife has been corrupted by the non-physical entity known as global warming. These marine biologists decide to take matters into their own hands, going on an expedition to cleanse the sea and stop this infectious spread.  </p> <p align="left"> Each player is controlling a marine biologist within a submarine with the goal of activating a series of purifiers. The submarine has multiple stations in which each player may attach themselves to. Additionally, the submarine is equipped with an oxygen and pressure level bar, indicating its current state. Along the way, corrupted sea life will attack the submarine, depleting its oxygen level. If oxygen is completely depleted, the players have failed their mission. To win, players must be working with each other by occasionally switching stations to aid each other in dire situations. </p> <h4 align="left"> Gameplay </h4> <p align="left"> The game is meant to be played using an xbox or ps4 controller, although the tutorial in the beginning of the game references xbox controller inputs. The game supports up to 4 players/controllers, and will load up characters based on the number of controllers connected. Each character is unique to the player. </p> <p align="left"> Game begins with a tutorial explaining controls and objectives, which initially entails moving around the submarine and laching onto stations. Each station performs a specific action. There are a total of 6 stations that comprise of 4 turret stations, 1 steering station, and 1 map station. Each of the turret stations control a single turret capable of firing bullets at incoming enemies. The steering station allows the player to manuever the submarine underwater, and the map station allows all players to view a minimap of the surrounding area. The primary goal of the player steering the submarine is to attach the submarine to each purifier while dodging enemies. Oxygen within the submarine is constantly depleting at a steady rate, and under low pressure this rate increases. Additionally, there are enemies attacking the submarine which will further deplete oxygen. When the submarine is attached to a purifier, it takes some time for the submarine to fully activate it. During this time interval, a swarm of enemies will rush towards the submarine to attempt to halt this process. If players are able to successfully activate the purifier before oxygen runs out, oxygen is replenished as a reward and players get to choose between a power up. The power ups include turret, steering, and map enhancements. Along the way there will be oxygen bubbles that the player steering the submarine can collect to replenish a small portion of oxygen and these oxygen bubbles may form an arrow to indicate the direction to travel. Once all purifiers are activated, players enter a final boss fight. </p> <h4 align="left"> Art </h4> <p align="left"> All art, with the exception of a single background used during gameplay, is custom made via Photoshop and inspired by Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime.
